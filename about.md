My name is Kailea Lee, a senior at Southern University majoring in Computer Science with a focus in Cybersecurity. I conduct research on topics like vehicle-to-grid security, AI in education, and VR cybersecurity through programs at my school. I’m also a docent at LIGO, a Manager in Training at Hibbett Sports, and an active member of organizations like NSBE and SWE. My goal is to become a Digital Forensic Examiner at the FBI and start my own security company.

### More Information

I’m deeply interested in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and cutting-edge technologies, and I enjoy sharing insights from my journey as a student, researcher, and future professional in the tech field.
