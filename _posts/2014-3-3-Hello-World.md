👋🏽 Hi! My name is Kailea Lee, and I’m from Louisiana. I’m currently a senior at Southern University and A&M College majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity 🔐. I'm passionate about technology, digital forensics 🧪, and exploring how emerging innovations 💡 impact the world around us. Outside of the classroom, I stay active in research 🔍, student organizations 🤝, and mentorship programs 🌱 that help me grow as a scholar and future professional.

🚫 I don’t have any prior experience with open source, but I’m excited to dive into it for the first time this summer 🧭. I’ve heard a lot about how open source projects create opportunities for learning 📚, collaboration 🤝, and building real-world skills 🛠️, and I’m looking forward to gaining hands-on experience. This will be a valuable chance for me to explore the community, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow as a developer 💻.

⚙️ One of the strongest characteristics I bring to my team is my adaptability 🔄. Whether I’m juggling school, research, or work, I know how to adjust quickly and stay focused under pressure 🎯. I also bring strong communication skills 🗣️ and enjoy organizing tasks and documentation 📝, which helps keep projects moving smoothly and ensures everyone is on the same page.

💬 A skill I’d really like to improve this summer is my confidence in coding collaboratively with others 👩🏽‍💻👨🏽‍💻. Sometimes I second guess my work when sharing it publicly, especially in new environments. To grow in this area, I plan to ask more questions ❓, review other contributors’ code 👀, and push myself to actively participate in team discussions and pull requests 🔄. By staying involved and open to feedback, I know I’ll gain more confidence over time 🚀.
