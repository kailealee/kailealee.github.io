Since starting the Contributor Catalyst 2025 Program, Iâ€™ve made real progress toward my goal of becoming more confident in coding collaboratively. Iâ€™ve contributed to issues, submitted pull requests, and stayed active in team discussions. Sharing my work publicly doesnâ€™t feel as intimidating now because Iâ€™ve seen how valuable my input can be.

To keep improving, I plan to take on another beginner friendly issue, give more feedback on others contributions, and help finalize our Codespaces documentation. Every small step builds more confidence.

Iâ€™d appreciate continued encouragement from Emily, Silas, and Samir, especially when it comes to tackling technical challenges. Your support and feedback help me grow and feel more comfortable speaking up and contributing.
