Over the past week, my team and I began exploring the OpenSSF community, and it's been a great experience so far! We started by reviewing the repository and identifying beginner-friendly issues that aligned with our skill sets and interests.

After some digging, we found an issue to work on and decided to go for it. Using GitHub Codespaces, I was able to make the necessary changes right from my browser, which made the whole process smooth and efficient. Once I finished the fix, I submitted a pull request, my first real contribution to OpenSSF!

### What’s Next? 🚧

Now that we’ve gotten comfortable with the contribution process, we’re planning to take on another beginner-friendly issue as a team to keep building confidence and reinforcing what we’ve learned.

At the same time, I’m personally looking forward to tackling something a bit more technical, especially an issue related to Scorecard check logic. I think it’s a great next step to dive deeper into the core of the project and grow my skills along the way.

Excited to keep building and contributing 💪🏽
