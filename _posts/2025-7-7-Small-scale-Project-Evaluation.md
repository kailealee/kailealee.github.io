title: "Evaluating the OpenSSF Scorecard Project"

This week in lab, we explored a project called [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard). It’s a tool designed to check the security of open-source GitHub repositories. Scorecard runs a set of automated checks and gives each project a score based on how well it follows best security practices. Some of the things it looks at include whether the project uses branch protection, reviews code before merging, and keeps dependencies up to date. The idea is to give people a quick sense of whether a project is safe to use or contribute to.

The project is maintained by the Open Source Security Foundation and has over 80 contributors. However, most of the recent work seems to come from a smaller group of active maintainers. From looking at the activity on GitHub, it’s clear the project is being regularly updated, with new issues and pull requests coming in and getting addressed pretty often.

If someone wanted to start helping with Scorecard, the best place to begin would be the repository’s README file and the CONTRIBUTING guide. These documents explain how to install and run the tool, and how to get involved as a contributor. The instructions are clear and beginner-friendly, especially if you’re already familiar with basic development tools.

The project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. There are quite a few open issues, but many have recent comments or are already being worked on. Some are even labeled as “good first issue,” which helps newcomers find tasks that are manageable and well-defined.

Installing Scorecard doesn’t look too difficult. You’ll need to have Go and Docker installed, but once those are set up, following the installation steps should take about 20 to 30 minutes. The documentation makes it pretty easy to get started.

Most of the project communication seems to happen directly on GitHub. Developers discuss changes in pull request threads and comment on issues. While there may be other spaces like Slack or mailing lists for broader OpenSSF discussions, everything you need to get started with Scorecard is available on GitHub.

One of the most interesting things we learned through this process was how tools like Scorecard help protect open-source communities by making security checks easier and more transparent. It showed us that software security isn’t just about fixing bugs—it’s also about creating good habits and using tools that keep those habits in place. Overall, it was a great example of how open-source tools can make a big impact.
