**Stepping into Open Source: My Journey Begins!**

Hi! My name is Kailea Lee, and I’m from Louisiana. I’m a senior at [Southern University and A&M College](https://www.subr.edu/) , majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I’m passionate about technology, digital forensics, and exploring how emerging innovations impact the world around us.

This summer, I’m participating in the Contributor Catalyst 2025 Program in Santa Cruz, where I’m getting hands-on experience with open source for the first time. I’m excited to learn new skills, collaborate with others, and contribute to meaningful projects.

One of my strengths is adaptability, balancing school, research, and work has taught me how to adjust quickly and stay focused under pressure. I also bring strong communication skills and enjoy organizing tasks and documentation to help projects run smoothly.

A skill I’d like to improve this summer is my confidence in coding collaboratively. I sometimes second guess my work when sharing it publicly, especially in unfamiliar environments. To grow in this area, I plan to ask more questions, review other contributors’ code, and stay active in team discussions and pull requests.
