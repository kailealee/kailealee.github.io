title: "Exploring the p5.js Open Source Project"

This week in lab, I took a closer look at p5.js, a large-scale open-source project designed to make creative coding more accessible. It’s a JavaScript library that helps people, especially artists, educators, and beginners, create interactive visuals, animations, and sound-based projects for the web. What stood out to me is how intentionally the project focuses on inclusion and learning, offering a welcoming space for people who might not have a traditional programming background.

There are a lot of people involved in this project. On GitHub, it has hundreds of contributors, and a good number of them are still actively pushing updates, reviewing issues, and engaging in conversations. The project is very active, with recent commits and ongoing discussions happening daily. It’s clear that there’s a strong and committed community behind it.

If I wanted to get involved, the best place to start would be the GitHub repository. There’s a clear contributing guide that explains how to set things up, follow coding standards, and submit pull requests. They also have a code of conduct and labels like “good first issue” that make it easier for beginners to jump in. The documentation is really helpful too, with a detailed reference page full of examples, tutorials, and explanations for almost every function in the library.

Bugs and feature requests are tracked through GitHub Issues. There are quite a few open issues, over 700, but many of them are being actively worked on. You can tell the team and community take time to respond, tag, and follow up. It seems like a well-organized and responsive system overall.

Getting started with p5.js doesn’t take long. You can include the library in an HTML file using a content delivery link or install it with npm if you’re using Node.js. Either way, it should only take a few minutes to download and set up.

For communication, most of the activity happens on GitHub, but there’s also a Discourse forum and a Slack workspace. These spaces are used for help requests, project updates, and conversations about new ideas. It feels like a community that really encourages learning and collaboration.

The most interesting thing I learned from this experience is how coding can be used for artistic expression. I had mostly seen programming in technical or academic settings, but this project reminded me that technology can be creative too. That shift in perspective was exciting.

Even though I appreciated the mission and scale of p5.js, I actually prefer the OpenSSF Scorecard project I looked into earlier. It’s smaller and more focused, which made it feel more approachable. The community is more contained, and I think it would be easier to jump in, find something to work on, and make a real impact. If I had the chance to contribute to one of these projects, I’d choose Scorecard.
