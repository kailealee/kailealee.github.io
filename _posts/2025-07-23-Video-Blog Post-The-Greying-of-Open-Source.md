Abby Cabunoc Mayes talk, “Who Will Maintain the Future?” highlights key challenges facing open source today, burnout, unclear onboarding, and the lack of support for new contributors. These issues are visible across many projects, where a small number of maintainers often carry too much of the burden with little help or structure for long-term sustainability.

Her message about the “graying” of open source and the emotional toll of maintenance rings true. Without systems in place to share responsibilities or prepare the next wave of contributors, it’s easy for maintainers to burn out or step away entirely.

From a Gen Z perspective, community and purpose play a big role in deciding whether to engage. Welcoming environments, well-scoped beginner issues, and public recognition (like shoutouts or badges) make open source more accessible. Platforms like Discord or Slack also offer peer spaces that lower the barrier to entry and encourage participation.

Talks like Abby’s are an important reminder: the future of open source depends on creating spaces that are sustainable, inclusive, and designed for people, not just code.
