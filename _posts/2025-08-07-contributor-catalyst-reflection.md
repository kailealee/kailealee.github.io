title: "Reflections as a Contributor Catalyst Fellow: OpenSSF Experience"

Nearly eight weeks ago, I set a personal goal of becoming more confident in contributing to open-source codebases by learning how to engage with issues, write clear documentation, and push meaningful contributions. Coming into this program, I had no experience with collaborative development, especially at the scale and impact level of a project like OpenSSF Scorecard. I wanted to overcome the initial intimidation and uncertainty I often felt when approaching large GitHub repositories. Through consistent practice, team collaboration, and mentorship, I hoped to walk away with a better understanding of how open source ecosystems work and the confidence to continue contributing beyond the program.

Looking back, I feel proud of the progress I made. I’ve gained hands-on experience navigating a real-world open source repository, engaging with maintainers, submitting pull requests, and researching unfamiliar code. I didn’t reach every milestone perfectly, but I absolutely reached my goal. I now feel more capable and less hesitant when approaching open-source issues. The encouragement and structure of the Catalyst Fellowship helped extremely, as did working closely with my teammates Kaylee and Devon. If I were to push this goal further in the future, I’d like to strengthen my technical knowledge of Go and explore more coding focused contributions, in addition to documentation.

Throughout this project, I collaborated with Kaylee, Devon, Denzel, and Jakiya on a bunch of Scorecard issues. One of our earliest contributions was fixing a CI-Test description to align with maintainer feedback (#4708). Afterward, we explored issue #4717, where we tested a subfield in a GitHub Actions workflow and correctly replicated a 0/10 score. We later created a test repository and conducted further experiments based on maintainer suggestions. We also brainstormed documentation for setting up GitHub Codespaces, trying to advocate for beginner-friendly tools after learning how complex local terminal setups could be which didn't work out in the end but is fine.

We contributed to several other issues. One of the most challenging issues was #4258. It required us to identify a specific file that needed editing, but the file was not clearly mentioned or easy to locate. We spent hours researching, but couldn’t confirm the problem and file. We ultimately left a comment asking for guidance, a humbling reminder that sometimes the best path forward is asking for help.

On the other hand, one of the most rewarding issues we worked on was our pull request that improved the README by fixing the format of the command and its expected output, as part of issue #4272. It seemed like a small change at first, but it had a significant impact. Clear and accurate documentation ensures that contributors aren’t confused when running the command, so we reformatted it by separating the command from the output, allowing the command to be easily copied and the output to be clearly understood. We took the time to verify the command ourselves, ensured it produced the correct output, and then submitted the changes.

Overall, my experience as a Contributor Catalyst Fellow has been great. I’ve learned how open-source projects operate, how to communicate effectively with maintainers, and how to tackle both technical and non-technical contributions. I’ve learned how to ask for help when stuck and how to scope an issue. The help from Spencer and support from our program leads made a huge difference. The structure helped me push through confusion 
and uncertainty, and the feedback helped me grow.

I’m especially grateful for the mentorship I received from Emily, Silas, and Samir throughout the program. Their guidance, encouragement, and thoughtful feedback helped me stay motivated, think critically, and grow as a contributor.
I now feel equipped with enough tools to contribute independently to other open-source projects. I understand how to read through contribution guidelines, assess issues, and make a plan. While I still have a lot to learn in terms of deeper coding contributions (especially in Go), I’ve overcome the hardest part…getting started.
I absolutely plan to stay engaged in open source beyond this program. I’ve already started looking at repositories to explore next, and I hope to make consistent monthly contributions. This experience has reshaped my view of open source. It’s no longer a space that feels exclusive or overly complex. It’s a community that welcomes curiosity, effort, and collaboration, and I’m glad I took the first step into it.
