Yesterday, July 10, I had an incredible day exploring the tech scene in San Francisco and Oakland! We kicked things off with a visit to GitHub, where ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· [PJ Metz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/metzinaround/) gave us a tour and shared his journey and insights into the tech world. It was inspiring to see how collaboration, creativity, and community drive innovation at such a large scale.

Later in the day, we had dinner and meaningful conversations with [Kenyatta Forbes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenyatta-f/) about navigating tech careers, applying to grad school, and making space for underrepresented voices in the industry. These moments reminded me of the power of connection and the importance of staying curious and open to new opportunities.

Grateful for the experience and excited to apply what I learned as I continue growing in tech and open source.
